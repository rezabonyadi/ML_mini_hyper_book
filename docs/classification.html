<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Classification</h1>
<p>Classification refers to learning to categorize instances by labeled examples. For example, learning if a person going to have a heart attack after their 50’s given person’s characteristics such as smoking habits, history of a heart attack in the family, number of hours of exercise per day, height, weight, among others. The task is to find a general <em>rule</em> which estimates, for any given person with given characteristics, if the person is going to have a heart attack after their 50s. Another example of classification is, given some attributes of a set of tumors (e.g., shape, color, genetic information, history of the patient, among others) and their categories (benign, type 1, type 2, or type 3), find a generic rule that estimates the tumor type for any tumor. The rule (also known as the model) is optimized by given examples of the problem to be solved.</p>
<p>In a more general framework, given a set of instances, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> rows and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> columns (each row is an instance and each column is an attribute) and their associated classes, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> rows (containing a categorical value in each row), find a mathematical <em>rule</em> (line and hyperplane are special cases of this), also known as a <em>model</em>, which can generate the class label, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, for any given instance, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> row and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> columns).</p>
<p>A synthetic classification problem has been shown in Fig. <a href="classification.html#fig:classExample">2.1</a>. In this problem, there are two attributes per instance and two groups of instances (blue and red), and the discriminatory rule has been assumed to be represented by a line. The aim of classification (binary in this case) with these assumptions is to find the “best” discriminatory line (hyperplane in a higher number of dimensions) which discriminates between the two classes “optimally” (see figure). Ideally, this optimality needs to make sure that the rule not only works for the given data (training data) based on a performance measure but also for any unseen data point (test data), referred to as the <em>generalization ability</em> of the rule.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As usually the given instances do not represent all possible instances for a given problem, therefore, any rule, in any shape and form, that separates the given instances and optimizes the performance measure is acceptable (purple, green, and orange lines in the figure). Hence, defining “the best discriminatory rule”, a rule that not only separates the given instances but also all other unseen instances, is not possible. This leads to different assumptions upon which different classifiers are formulated. For example, support vector machines assume that the discriminatory rule is represented by a line which has the maximum distance from the instances in each class. The idea is that such a line is more empirically robust against potential uncertainties in unseen instances.</p>
<p>See <span class="citation">(Ng and Jordan <a href="#ref-ng2002discriminative">2002</a>)</span> for a formal definition of discriminative classification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification aims to find a mathematical rule, aka model, that provides the category to which an instance belongs using a set of given examples.</li>
<li>As the training data-set is a subset of all possible data points, some assumptions need to be made to ensure that the “optimal” rule performs well not only on the training data-set but also on unseen instances (generalization ability).</li>
<li>These assumptions include the shapes of the mathematical rule (a line, “if-then” rules, etc.) and the <em>performance measure</em> by which the rule is evaluated.</li>
<li>Different classification methods usually differ by their assumptions and performance measures used.</li>
</ul>

<div id="loss-function-for-classification" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> 0/1 loss function for classification</h2>
<p>Let’s assume that the discriminatory rule (model) in a two-class classification problem , aka a binary classification problem, is represented by a line (hyperplane in more than 2 dimensions). The objective is to find a hyperplane that “optimally” discriminates between the classes. To do so, we need an evaluation procedure which measures a “wrongness” score for any given hyperplane (called the <em>loss function</em>). Then, an optimization algorithm searches over all possible hyperplanes to find the one which minimizes the loss function (see Fig. <a href="classification.html#fig:findingLine">2.2</a>).</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:findingLine"></span>
<img src="images/classification/finding_line_n.gif" alt="The objective is to find a line/hyperplane that separates the instances optimally. The search continues until a suitable hyperplane, evaluated by the loss function, is found. The final line found in this example classifies all instances correctly except one." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.2: The objective is to find a line/hyperplane that separates the instances optimally. The search continues until a suitable hyperplane, evaluated by the loss function, is found. The final line found in this example classifies all instances correctly except one.
</p>
</div>
<p>Ideally, we expect the optimizer to find a hyperplane for which all instances from each class fall in one side of it and the instances from the other class fall in the other side of the hyperplane. Hence, one simple loss function would be to count the number of instances that are not in the “correct” side of the hyperplane, which is called the <em>0/1 loss function</em>. The outcome of this minimization is a hyperplane which has a minimum 0/1 loss value, i.e., the number of instances that are in the wrong side of the hyperplane is minimized.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:loss01"></span>
<img src="images/classification/0_1_loss_1.PNG" alt="Two candidate lines, green gives 4/30 and the orange gives 4/30 loss value according to the 0/1 loss function." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.3: Two candidate lines, green gives 4/30 and the orange gives 4/30 loss value according to the 0/1 loss function.
</p>
</div>
<p>  One should note that there might be many hyperplanes which have the same 0/1 loss value, which means the solutions to the 0/1 loss function is not unique. In Fig. <a href="classification.html#fig:loss01">2.3</a>, for example, the 0/1 loss value is the same for the green line and the orange line.</p>
<div id="improvements" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Improvements</h3>
<p>The 0/1 loss function in its original form does not take into account the <em>importance</em> of the instances from different classes (all classes are assumed to be equally important). In the previous example (Fig. <a href="classification.html#fig:loss01">2.3</a>), the number of blue instances is smaller than the number of red instances, which means miss-classification of blue instances leads to a larger natural loss comparing to the red instances (blue instances are rare, hence more important to be classified correctly). For example, the orange line has a very high accuracy on red instances while its accuracy on the blue is not as high as the green line. To address this issue, it has been proposed in <span class="citation">(Bonyadi and Reutens <a href="#ref-bonyadi2019optimal">2019</a>)</span> to minimize the average percentage of mis-classified instances accross all classes rather than counting the number of mis-classified instances. In Fig. <a href="classification.html#fig:loss01">2.3</a>, for example, this average for the green line is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(2/10+2/20)}{2}\)</span> (2 miss-classified instances from each class) and for the orange line is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3/10+1/20}{2}\)</span> (3 miss-classified from blue and 1 from red). Hence, the green line would be preferred.</p>
<p>Finding a line, or a hyperplane in larger number of dimensions, that minimizes the average of the 0/1 loss function in both above-mentioned forms is not easy (see <span class="citation">(Doerr et al. <a href="#ref-doerr2015direct">2015</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">(Bonyadi and Reutens <a href="#ref-bonyadi2019optimal">2019</a>)</span>). One issue is that this line is not unique. For example, both orange and green lines in Fig. 1 have the same accuracy in terms of discriminating between the classes. This is solved by selecting the line (hyperplane) which has the maximum distance from the instances of both classes (see this <span class="citation">(Bonyadi and Reutens <a href="#ref-bonyadi2019optimal">2019</a>)</span>), called maximum margin hyperplane. The basic idea is, if there are multiple lines (hyperplanes) which separate instances from each class with the same accuracy, the one which has the maximum distance from each class is preferred. Otehr improvements in <span class="citation">(Bonyadi and Reutens <a href="#ref-bonyadi2019optimal">2019</a>)</span> included addition of <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> regularization, that enables the usage of coefficients for estimation of variable importance.</p>

Any hyperplane can be represented by its normal vector (norm), <span class="math inline">\(\vec w\)</span>, and an intercept, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\vec w, b&gt;\)</span>.

One way to define the 0/1 loss function in its original form is then as follows:
<span class="math display" id="eq:binaryLoss">\[\begin{equation}

<p>There are two equivalent geometrical views to imagine the discrimination by a hyperplane.

<div id="logistic-regression" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Logistic regression</h2>
<p>Logistic regression seeks a hyperplane which best discriminates two classes. The hyperplane is evaluated by a loss function which is a smooth (differentiable) estimation of the function used in the 0/1 loss function (see Section <a href="classification.html#sec:01lossMath">2.1.2</a>), hence, can be optimized effectively by a gradient descent. For a given hyperplane, the estimation provides a value between 0 and 1 (rather than 0 or 1 as it was the case in the 0/1 loss function) for each instance that represents to what extent the instance has been classified as the class 0 or class 1. While there might be many different choices for such function, logistic regression uses the logarithm sigmoid function that looks like Fig. <a href="classification.html#fig:logsig">2.7</a>.</p>

The value of <span class="math inline">\(\vec w \vec x_i^T + b\)</span> is an indication of the distance between the hyperplane and the instance while ths ign of it indicates to which side of the hyperplane ths instance belong. When we put this value for an instance in the logarithm sigmoid function, we would get a value close to zero when <span class="math inline">\(\vec w \vec x_i^T + b&lt;0\)</span> and a value close to one otherwise. If <span class="math inline">\(\vec w \vec x_i^T + b\)</span> is close to zero the sigmoid function returns values closer to <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>, which may be interpreted as ambiguous. Ideal hyperplane would lead to large positive and large negative values for <span class="math inline">\(\vec w \vec x_i^T + b\)</span> to ensure smaller loss value.</p>
<div id="variable-importance" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Variable importance</h3>
<p>The coefficients of the hyperplane found by the logistic regression cannot be interpreted directly as indicator for variable importance. The reason is that the variables ranges might be inherently different, meaning that some coefficients need to be larger to compensate for larger values. For example, if the values of one variable is in the range of 1000 and the other is in the range of 0.1, it is expected that the coefficients related to the first variable to be larger. This, however, does not show that the first variable is more important than the second.</p>
<p>If the value of variables are standardized (see Section <a href="sec-preprocessing.html#sec:preprocessing">11</a>), however, the coefficients can be used as indicators of importance. The idea is that, the smaller the absolute value of a coefficient is the less important that variable is. To imagine this, think of a variable that is not important at all (see Fig. ???). We expect the discriminatory hyperplane to have a small or zero coefficient value for that variable.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Bayes classifier</h2>
<p>For a classification task, Bayes classifier calculates how likely it is that a given instance belongs to each class. Intuitively, the probability that a given instance, <span class="math inline">\(\vec x\)</span>, belongs to a class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> depends on two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Prior</em>: How likely it is that any given instance belongs to the class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in general.</li>
<li><em>Likelihood</em>: If we know an instance from class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, how likely it is that instance looks like <span class="math inline">\(\vec x\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any given instance, we calculate these two and multiply their values. The outcome is a measure (not exact) of the probability if that instance belongs to class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. The larger this value, the more likely it is that the instance belongs to the class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>This approach is called the <em>Bayes optimal classifier</em>. The first component is easy to calculate given the history. We can simply count the number of instances in the class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and divide that by the total number of training instances, which represents how likely it is that an instance come from that class. The second component is very difficult, if possible, to calculate if we assume that the attributes are not independent. The reason is each instance is a <em>mix</em> of multiple attributes, some might be the same as what has been observed in the training set, some might not be. The comparison between these instances to calculate the <em>likelihood</em> is difficult as all attributes need to be considered at the same time. If we assume independence between variables, however, that probability is calculated easily. This is called the <em>Naive Bayes</em> classifier because the independence assumption is somewhat “naive”. For a given instance <span class="math inline">\(\vec x\)</span>, for each attribute, we calculate how likely it is that an instance from class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> has the same value as of <span class="math inline">\(\vec x\)</span> for that attribute, i.e., attributes are independent. We then multiply those probabilities which would be an estimate of the original likelihood with mixed variables.</p>
<div id="more-details-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> More details</h3>
<p>Bayes classifier calculates the probability of the class of an instance <span class="math inline">\(\vec x\)</span> belonging to class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> given the instance, which is written as:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:bayesFormulae">\[\begin{equation}
P(Y=c|\vec x) = \frac{P(\vec x|Y=c)P(Y=c)}{P(\vec x)} \tag{2.3}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P(\vec x|Y=c)\)</span> is the likelihood of <span class="math inline">\(\vec x\)</span> belonging to class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the class label), <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=c)\)</span> is the prior knowledge about the class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> in general, and <span class="math inline">\(P(\vec x)\)</span> is called the evidence. Calculation of the evidence and likelihood is difficult as the instance <span class="math inline">\(\vec x\)</span> is a mixture of attributes, which may be dependent (see <span class="citation">(Wikipedia <a href="#ref-bayesNaiveWiki">2016</a>)</span> for complete calculation of these probabilities). However, considering independence between variables, <span class="math inline">\(P(\vec x|Y=c)=P(x_1|Y=c)P(x_2|Y=c)...P(x_n|Y=c)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=c)\)</span> is easy to calculate as it is equal to the number of instances in the class <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> divided by the number of instances in the training set. While the calculation of evidence is also straightforward under the independence assumption, it is not needed as it is constant across all classes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> K-nearest neighbor</h2>
<p>The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier assumes that the instances “close” to one another have the same class label. Hence, to assign a class label to a new instance, KNN finds <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> instances from the training data set to which the new instance is “closest” and use those labels to vote for the class label of the new instance (see Fig. <a href="classification.html#fig:KnnDemons">2.8</a>).</p>

<div id="improvements-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1</span> Improvements</h3>
<p>In KNN, some attributes may lead to a biased distance. For example, if one of the attributes is in the order of 1,000 and another is in the order of 0.1, the latter would have a small impact on the calculation of the distance. This is usually resolved by standardizing the space, which ensures all attributes are in the same range. This method, however, may break some structural integrity of the instances.</p>
<p>Another issue is that some attributes might be misleading and their impact is better to be reduced. For example, Fig. <a href="classification.html#fig:KnnDimesions">2.9</a> indicates that the horizontal dimension is responsible for the green instance to be of the type “red”. This, however, may not be correct as if the horizontal dimension shrinks then the green instance becomes closer to blue instances, which makes it a blue class.</p>

<p>This indeed leads to an in-accuracy in KNN; the algorithm does not take into account the importance of attributes.
