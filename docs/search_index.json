["index.html", "Optimization and Machine Learning: A Collection Preface", " Optimization and Machine Learning: A Collection Reza Bonyadi, Ph.D. 2019-07-25 Preface I wrote my first machine learning (ML) project in the autumn of 2000, which was a characters hand-written recognition in the Pascal language, and I quite enjoyed the topic ever since. The field is growing astronomically fast these days and everyday I am learning something new. One reason behind such fast growth is that the top largest companies in the world, i.e., Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Apple, all invest their largest R&amp;D budgets on this. This collection (or as I call it, hyper-book) is meant to document and centralize the best links, descriptions, and material in each topic I found for my learning. The intention is not to re-write what has been written hundereds of times by very skilled authors, but to summarize methods, rank best pages/books which describe them, and refer to programming codes I found the best for that topic, if relevant. For each topic I provide my oppinions on what it is and when/where/why/and how to use it. To ensure the audience of this collection covers a larger range, I keep the descriptions simple and to the point, with minimum mathematical equations, if possible. "],
