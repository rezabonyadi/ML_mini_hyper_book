["index.html", "Optimization and Machine Learning: A Collection Preface", " Optimization and Machine Learning: A Collection Reza Bonyadi, Ph.D. 2019-07-26 Preface I wrote my first machine learning (ML) project in the autumn of 2000, which was a characters hand-written recognition in the Pascal language, and I quite enjoyed the topic ever since. The field is growing astronomically fast these days and everyday I am learning something new. One reason behind such fast growth is that the top largest companies in the world, i.e., Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Apple, all invest their largest R&amp;D budgets on this. This collection (or as I call it, hyper-book) is meant to document and centralize the best links, descriptions, and material in each topic I found for my learning. The intention is not to re-write what has been written hundereds of times by very skilled authors, but to summarize methods, rank best pages/books which describe them, and refer to programming codes I found the best for that topic, if relevant. For each topic I provide my oppinions on what it is and when/where/why/and how to use it. To ensure the audience of this collection covers a larger range, I keep the descriptions simple and to the point, with minimum mathematical equations, if possible. "],

["classification.html", "Chapter 2 Classification 2.1 Logistic regression 2.2 Support vector machines 2.3 Decision tree 2.4 K-nearest neighbor", " Chapter 2 Classification Classification refers to learning by examples to categorize instances. For example, you are given a data-set of people who got a heart attach or no heart attack after their 50. Each instance has been characterized by attributes such as smoking habits, history of heart attack in the family, number of hours of exercise per day, hight, weight, among others. The task is to estimate, for a given characteristics of a new person, if the person is going to have a heart attack after their 50. Another example of classification is that given some attributes of a tumor (e.g., shape, color, genetic information, history of the patient, among others), estimate if the tumor type is benign, type 1, type 2, or type 3. In a more general framework, given a set of instances (\\(X\\), which has \\(m\\) rows and \\(n\\) columns, each row is an instance and each column is an attribute) and their associated classes (\\(Y\\), which has \\(m\\) rows, containing a categorical value in each row), we seek a mathematical rule which can generate the class label, \\(y\\), for any given instance, \\(x\\) (\\(1\\) row and \\(n\\) columns). 2.1 Logistic regression 2.1.1 Variable importance in LR 2.2 Support vector machines What is support vector machine 2.2.1 Kernel tricks 2.2.2 Implementations 2.3 Decision tree 2.4 K-nearest neighbor What is it Why does it work How to implement "],
