# My mini hyper-book of Machine Learning

I wrote my first machine learning (ML) project in the year 1999, which was a characters hand-written recognition in the Pascal language, and I quite enjoyed the topic ever since. The field is growing astronomically fast these days and everyday I am learning something new. This document is meant to maintain my learnings and provides the best links, descriptions, and material in each topic.
