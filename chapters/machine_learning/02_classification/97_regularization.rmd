## Regularization
***Category D***

Let's assume that we are fitting a model $M(X, \theta)$ to the instances $X$, given labels $Y$, using an optimization algorithm and an evaluation metric, $E(M(X, \theta), Y)$, which provides a scaler describing how dissimilar is $M(X, \theta)$ to the corresponding $Y$. 

\begin{equation}
min_{\theta}  ~E(M(X, \theta), Y) (\#eq:optimizationOrginal)
\end{equation}

Depending on the definition of $E$ and $M$, this problem might not have a unique solution. Hence, the optimization algorithm should be informed which solution is more acceptable so that it converges to what it supposed to. Here comes regularization. It provides another constraint, formulated into the objective function for convenience (see section ???? to see how is this possible), to make the solution unique, as follows: 

\begin{equation}
min_{\theta}  ~E(M(X, \theta), Y) + \alpha R(\theta) (\#eq:optimizationregularized)
\end{equation}

where $R(\theta)$ is the regularization term and $\alpha$ is the regularization weight. 

### Famous types

As the idea is a "simpler" model has a better chance to generalize better (see Section \@ref(sec:biasVariance)), the regularization term is defined in a way that it simplifies the model. Two of most frequently used regularization terms are called $L_1$ (aka LASSO) and $L_2$ (special case of Tikhonov), defined by $||\theta||_1=\sum_i |\theta_i|$ and $||\theta||_2=\sum_i \theta_i^2$, respectively.

Another useful regularization term is the $L_0$ which counts the number of non-zero
