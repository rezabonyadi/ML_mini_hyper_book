## Bayes classifier

For a classification task, Bayes classifier calculates how likely it is that a given instance belongs to each class. Intuitively, the probability that a given instance, $\vec x$, belongs to a class $c$ depends on two main components:

* *Prior*: How likely it is that any given instance belongs to the class $c$ in general. 
* *Likelihood*: If we know an instance from class $c$, how likely it is that instance looks like $\vec x$.

The first component is easy to calculate given the history. We can simply count the number of instances in the class $c$ and divide that by the total number of training instances. The second component is very difficult to calculate if we assume that the attributes are not independent. If we assume they are independent then that probability is calculated by multiplying the probability of the value of each attribute appear in the instances of class $c$.

### Pros and cons

**Pros**:

* It is easy and fast to predict class of test data set. It also performs well in multi class prediction.
* When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.
* It performs well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s). For numerical variable, normal distribution is assumed (bell curve, which is a strong assumption).
  
**Cons**:

* If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as “Zero Frequency”. To solve this, we can use the smoothing technique.
* Another limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. In real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are completely independent.

For continuous variables, it is assumed that the variables follow a given disctribution (usually normal) to be able to calculate the probability of .
