## Bayes classifier

For a classification task, Bayes classifier calculates how likely it is that a given instance belongs to each class. Intuitively, the probability that a given instance, $\vec x$, belongs to a class $c$ depends on two main components:

* *Prior*: How likely it is that any given instance belongs to the class $c$ in general. 
* *Likelihood*: If we know an instance from class $c$, how likely it is that instance looks like $\vec x$.

For any given instance, we calculate these two and multiply their values. The outcome is a measure (not exact) of the probability if that instance belongs to class $c$. The larger this value, the more likely it is that the instance belongs to the class $c$.

This approach is called the *Bayes optimal classifier*. The first component is easy to calculate given the history. We can simply count the number of instances in the class $c$ and divide that by the total number of training instances, which represents how likely it is that an instance come from that class. The second component is very difficult, if possible, to calculate if we assume that the attributes are not independent. The reason is each instance is a *mix* of multiple attributes, some might be the same as what has been observed in the training set, some might not be. The comparison between these instances to calculate the *likelihood* is difficult as all attributes need to be considered at the same time. If we assume independence between variables, however, that probability is calculated easily. This is called the *Naive Bayes* classifier because the independence assumption is somewhat "naive". For a given instance $\vec x$, for each attribute, we calculate how likely it is that an instance from class $c$ has the same value as of $\vec x$ for that attribute, i.e., attributes are independent. We then multiply those probabilities which would be an estimate of the original likelihood with mixed variables. 

### More details
Bayes classifier calculates the probability of the class of an instance $\vec x$ belonging to class $c$ given the instance, which is written as:

\begin{equation}
P(Y=c|\vec x) = \frac{P(\vec x|Y=c)P(Y=c)}{P(\vec x)} (\#eq:bayesFormulae)
\end{equation}

where $P(\vec x|Y=c)$ is the likelihood of $\vec x$ belonging to class $c$ ($Y$ is the class label), $P(Y=c)$ is the prior knowledge about the class $c$ in general, and $P(\vec x)$ is called the evidence. Calculation of the evidence and likelihood is difficult as the instance $\vec x$ is a mixture of attributes, which may be dependent (see [@bayesNaiveWiki] for complete calculation of these probabilities). However, considering independence between variables, $P(\vec x|Y=c)=P(x_1|Y=c)P(x_2|Y=c)...P(x_n|Y=c)$. $P(Y=c)$ is easy to calculate as it is equal to the number of instances in the class $c$ divided by the number of instances in the training set. While the calculation of evidence is also straightforward under the independence assumption, it is not needed as it is constant across all classes.

Let's have an example. 

Table: (\#tab:bayesExample) An example data-set of male/female with their characteristics.

| Person | Height (>5.5 feet) | Weight (>150 lbs) | Foot size(>10 inches) |
|:------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------------:|
|  male  |          Y         |         Y         |           Y           |
|  male  |          Y         |         Y         |           N           |
|  male  |          Y         |         N         |           Y           |
|  male  |          Y         |         Y         |           Y           |
| female |          N         |         N         |           N           |
| female |          N         |         N         |           N           |
| female |          N         |         N         |           N           |
| female |          Y         |         N         |           N           |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given this data, we have been asked to which class a person belong if their Height is 6 (>5.5, hence 'Y'), their Weight is 130 (<150, hence 'N'), and their Foot size is 8 (<10, hence 'N'). Prior probability of being male is 0.5 and being female is 0.5, based on the table. It is clear that $P(x_1=Y|Y=female)=0.25$, $P(x_2=N|Y=female)=P(x_3=N|Y=female)=1.0$, and $P(Y=male)=P(Y=female)=0.5$. Hence, $P(Y=female|\vec x=<Y, N, N>)=\frac{0.25 \times 1.0 \times 1.0 \times 0.5}{P(\vec x)}$ and $P(Y=male|\vec x=<Y, N, N>)=\frac{1.0 \times 0.25 \times 0.25 \times 0.5}{P(\vec x)}$.As the evidence is the same for both probabilities, it seems it is more likely that the given instance is a "female".

### Continuous variables

### Pros and cons

**Pros**:

* It is easy and fast to predict class of test data set. It also performs well in multi class prediction.
* When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.
* It performs well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s). For numerical variable, normal distribution is assumed (bell curve, which is a strong assumption).
  
**Cons**:

* If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as “Zero Frequency”. To solve this, we can use the smoothing technique.
* Another limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. In real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are completely independent.

### Implementation

For continuous variables, it is assumed that the variables follow a given disctribution (usually normal) to be able to calculate the probability of .
