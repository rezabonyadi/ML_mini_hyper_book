## K-nearest neighbor 

The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier assumes that the instances "close" to one another have the same class label. Hence, to assign a class label to a new instances, KNN finds the $k$ "closest" instances from the training data set and use their labels to vote for the class label of the new instance.
