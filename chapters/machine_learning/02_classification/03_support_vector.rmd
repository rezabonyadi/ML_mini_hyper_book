## Support vector machines
***Category Intuitive***

Consider a binary classification problem and assume we want to use a hyperplane (linear model) to separate the classes. There might be many hyperplanes which separate the classes, all of which would result in the same mis-classification error. This encourages design of constraints which narrow down acceptable hyperplanes. One reasonable constraint is to pick the hyperplane which has maximum distance from the instances from both classes. This idea forms the bases for the support vector machine (SVM). 


```{r svm1, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.cap = 'The blue line has the same distance from the instances in each class, which is the idea behind SVM.'}

```

It is expected that SVM works better than Logistic Regression on the unseen instances. This, however, is not always true as the assumption behind SVM might not be always true and it is bound by the quality of the training data (see Section \@ref(sec:supervisedmodels)).

#### Formulation
The aim of SVM is to find a hyperplane which separates two classes while it has the same distance from each class. To ensure the hyperplane, defined by $<\vec{\theta}, b>$ where $\theta$ is the norm of the hyperplane, separates an instance $\vec{x}_i$ correctly, the inequality $y_i(\vec{x}_i\vec{\theta}^T+b)>0$ should be true. If this inequality is true then the transformation of the instance $\vec{x}_i$ by $\vec{x}_i\vec{\theta}^T+b$ would have the same sign as $y_i$, which can be used to determine the class of $\vec{x}_i$. Hence, SVM is defined by a constrained optimization problem with $m$ constraints, where $m$ is the number of instances. The objective is then to minimize $||\theta||_2$, which ensures that the hyperplane has the same distance from both classes. Eventually, this forms a quadratic program that can be solved by different methods (see Section ???).

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine#Linear_SVM) for more details on how this is formulated by the hinge loss and how it can be solved by gradient descent.

#### The linear model
While SVM aims can be formulated as a quadratic program, it can also be formulated by a linear program.
