## Support vector machines
Consider a binary classification problem and assume we want to use a hyperplane (linear model) to separate the classes. There might be many hyperplanes which separate the classes, all of which would result in the same mis-classification error. There is, however, only on of these hyperplanes which has maximum distance between the instances from both classes.
