# Introduction

Machine learning refers to a set of algorithms which make a machine (with a computer as its brain) to apparently learn. While learning in animals and human is not very well understood, in machines it is simply to find a generic rule, given a set of examples, which  

Machine learning refers to a set of methodologies that make machines apparently "learning" to perform tasks. Although it is hard to define learning, it is related to progressive improvement in performing a task successfully. Intuitively there are two types of learning: self-learning (unsupervised) and learning from others (supervised).

Not fully observed, hence, there need to be assumptions as the solutions is not unique

## Supervised and unsupervised learning {#sec:supervisedvsunsupervised}
In supervised learning the learner learns to accomplish a task with supervision, i.e., there is a set of instances that the learner learns from, or there is a system that provides feedback to the actions of the learner (reinforcement). Imagine for example you need a system to learn how to drive. For a human, we just hire an instructor and train the person and done. This is precisely the same for a machine, we provide instances or a feedback loop so that the machine can evaluate its performance and learns. Applications of supervised learning include self-driving cars, stock market prediction, object recognition, natural language processing, maintenance prediction, recommendation engines, weather forecast, and more.

In the unsupervised learning, the algorithm "figures out" the patterns in the instances, without any supervision. This is the more sophisticated while the most exciting use of machine learning. Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, product similarities, and many other applications require unsupervised learning.

A human or an animal learns from the environment by [re-structuring the connectivity of neurons in their brain](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/lifelong-learning-and-the-plastic-brain). The phenomenon has not been well understood yet but, in the abstract level, it is just like branching a graph, with billions of nodes and connections, to work better with the learning task at hand. The aim is to provide a generic (abstract) representation of the problem and the solution in the brain that is accessible when needed. This, however, is slightly different for a machine. The problem needs to first be translated into a "mathematical space" (coordinate systems, or simply numbers),the instances (samples of the learning task) need to be presented by their basic components (so-called features) in a "vector space" (numbers each with a particular meaning). 

## Supervised models {#sec:supervisedmodels}
Let's assume a set of $m$ instances, $X$, with $m$ rows and $n$ columns (each row is an instance and each column is a feature) and their associated responses, $Y$, with $m$ rows, is given (called the training data set). A supervised model $M(.,\theta)$, $\theta$ being model parameters (e.g., linear model), provides a generic rule by which the response, $y$, is correctly estimated for any given instance, $x$ ($1$ row and $n$ columns). The parameters $\theta$ are optimized by an optimizer for the model $M$ to best satisfy an *evaluation* metric (in some algorithms, this metric is called the *loss function*) which evaluates how similar $M(.,\theta)$ is to actual $y$ for each $x$ and any given $\theta$.

Usually, the given instances (training set) do not represent all possible instances for a given problem. Therefore, any model, in any shape and form, that transforms $X$ to $Y$ and optimizes the evaluation measure is acceptable. This means defining "the best model", a model that not only separates the given instances but also all other unseen instances, is limited by the knowledge encoded in the training set. This incomplete knowledge about the data leads the designer to make some *assumptions* on the model and the evaluation metric upon which different classifiers are formulated. For example, support vector machines in their original form assume that the discriminatory rule is represented by a line (an assumption on the model, a linear model) which has the maximum distance from the instances in each class (an assumption on the evaluation metric). The idea is that such a line is more empirically robust against potential uncertainties in unseen instances. 

It is important to design the model carefully as it is responsible to represent the "pattern" in the data in the most generic (low variance, see Section \@ref(sec:biasVariance)) and accurate (low bias) way. You may ask why not picking the most flexible mathematical equation in existence (e.g., Taylor series) and optimize its parameters to fit the given data? Flexible models (e.g., deep networks) may be able to fit the data well (simply because they are flexible and can fit anything), however, they might not be able to *generalize* well, i.e., work well for unseen data. Sometimes the models come from specific knowledge about the problem, e.g., physics models.
