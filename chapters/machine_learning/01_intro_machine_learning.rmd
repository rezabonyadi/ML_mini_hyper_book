# Introduction

Machine learning refers to a set of algorithms which make a machine (with a computer as its brain) to apparently learn. While learning in animals and human is not very well understood, in machines it is simply to find a generic rule, given a set of examples, which

## Supervised models
In a more general framework, given a set of instances, $X$, with $m$ rows and $n$ columns (each row is an instance and each column is an attribute) and their associated responses, $Y$, with $m$ rows, a supervised model $M(.,\theta)$, $\theta$ being model parameters (e.g., linear model), provides a generic rule by which the response, $y$, is correctly estimated for any given instance, $x$ ($1$ row and $n$ columns). The parameters $\theta$ are optimized by an optimizer for the model $M$ to best satisfy an *evaluation* metric (in some algorithms, this is called the *loss function*) which evaluates how similar $M(.,\theta)$ is to actual $y$ for each $x$ and any given $\theta$.

As the model is responsible to represent the "pattern" in the data in the most generic and accurate way, hence, very important to be designed carefully. You may ask why not picking the most flexible mathematical equation in existence (e.g., Taylor series) and optimize its parameters to fit the given data? Flexible models (e.g., deep networks) may be able to fit the data well (simply because they are flexible and can fit anything), however, they might not be able to *generalize* well, i.e., work well for unseen data. Sometimes the models come from specific knowledge about the problem, e.g., physics models. 

## The bias-variance debate {#sec:biasVariance} 
Assume there is a set of given instances, $X$ (m rows and n columns), and we are asked to optimize a model $M(X, \theta)$ to estimate $Y$ (m rows) given some examples, i.e., supervised learning. Let us call each instance $x$ and its corresponding desired output as $y$. In reality, $y$ is the outcome of a system working with inputs $x$, and some noise, $y=f(x)+\epsilon$, where $f(.)$ is not known and $\epsilon$ is noise which is also unknown. For example, if $x$ represents characteristics of people (smoking habit, weight, genetics, etc.) and $y$ is whether or not they would have a heart-attack after their 50s, then $f(x)$ is how body would respond to those characteristics and leads to a heart-attack or not, which is not really known. With modelling, we estimate this function $f(x)$, given some examples and some assumptions on the shape of $f$. 

A model M is responsible to estimate observed $Y$ as $Y=f(X)+\epsilon=M(X, \hat{\theta})+e$, where $e$ has $m$ rows and indicates the error from $Y$. If $e$ is small then $M(X, \hat{\theta})$ is an accurate estimation of $Y$, hence the model estimates not only $f$ but large amount of the noise $\epsilon$ in it. This takes place if the model $M$ is a complex, flexible, equation which is able to fit any complex behavior of $Y$ as function of $X$, including all fluctuations resulting from the noise. Hence, the outputs of the model will be similar to the values of $Y$ (non-biased), which includes noisy fluctuations, which leads to a high variance (fluctuations usually lead to large variance). If the model is not complex though, the gap between the output of the model and $Y$ might be large (bias), however, it would fit less to the noisy fluctuations in the $Y$ which leads to smaller variance. That is why it is said a complex model has a large variance and small bias, and vice versa. Formal calculation of this trade off can be found in the [bias-variance tradeoff in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff#Derivation).
