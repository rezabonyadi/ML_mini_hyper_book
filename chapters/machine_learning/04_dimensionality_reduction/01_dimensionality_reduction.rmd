## Matrix decomposition
In Mathematics, matrix decomposition aims to decompose a given matrix into two or more matrices for which the dot product is equal to th original matrix, i.e., $O=B \times C \times D \times...$ where $O$ is the original matrix. It is usually desirable that the matrices decomposed have some specific characteristics. For example,
