## Autoencoders

PCA’s objective is to find an invertible transformation from the original space of the data to a lower-dimensional space. In its original form, PCA seeks a linear transformation for this, however, it can be kernalized to enable the search for non-linear transformations. Autoencoder generalizes this idea, seeking a transformation (not necessarily linear) from original transformation to a lower-dimensional space (encoder) and another transformation that inverses the encoder (called decoder).

This can be formulated in general as: let f(., \theta): R^p -> R^n, and g(., \omega): R^n -> R^p, p< n, find \theta and \omega in a way that ||X-f(g(X, \omega), \theta)|| is minimized. For PCA, g(X, \omega) is XM, where M is a n by p matrix (assuming X is m by n) and g(X, \theta) is psodu-inverse of M (which is p by n).

Autoencoders are a type of deep neural networks that map the data to itself through a process of (non-linear) dimensionality reduction, followed by dimensionality expansion. Given X as an m by n matrix (m samples and n dimensions), M_i an n_i by n_{i+1} dimensional matrix, f_i a function R^{n_{i+1}} \to R^{n_{i+1}}, an autoencoder maps the samples by f_p(…f_3(f_2(f_1(XM_1)M_2)M_3)…M_p) etc., where p being the size of the last matrix, and it is equal to n. Usually, some middle layers have smaller number of dimensions than n (i.e., there exists an z where $n_z<<n$). The set of layers before z encode the information into n_i dimensions, while the layers after that decode the information back. The aim is to find the best values in M_is so that the, for each sample, the encoded and then decoded is the same. That means each sample is mapped to itself. Once optimized, the layer z embeds information in the n dimensions.

Autoencoders can be used for dimensionality reduction (detach the decoder, all n-dimensional samples are encoded into z dimensions) and anomaly detection (normal samples are mapped back to themselves with less error comparing to abnormal instances).
