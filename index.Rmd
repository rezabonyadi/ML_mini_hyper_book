I wrote my first machine learning (ML) project in the autumn of 2000, which was a characters hand-written recognition in the Pascal language, and I quite enjoyed the topic ever since. The field is growing astronomically fast these days and everyday I am learning something new. One reason behind such fast growth is that the top largest companies in the world, i.e., Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Apple, all invest their largest R&D budgets on this. 

This collection (or as I call it, hyper-book) is meant to document and centralize the best links, descriptions, and materials in each topic I found for my learning (so, basically my notes in an organized way with links). The intention is not to re-write what has been written hundreds of times by very skilled authors, but to summarize methods, rank best pages/books which describe them, and refer to programming codes I found the best for that topic, if relevant. For each topic I provide my opinions on what it is and when/where/why/and how to use it. To ensure the audience of this collection covers a larger range, I keep the descriptions simple and to the point, with minimum mathematical equations, if possible. 

The idea of this collection is not to undermine any Mathematical finding and theoretical background related to the fields reviewed here, but to pair those with intuitions and examples to make these topics more accessible for and larger audience. It is also important to notice the way the book has been organized, machine learning, statistics, and optimization, is not ideal, as it is difficult to separate these topics completely. I agree that many algorithms in machine learning these days is old news in statistics (e.g., linear regression), while some other algorithms may not have been possible to invent if statistics was going to be the main stream (e.g., deep neural networks). Topics like derivative-based optimization are so heavily involved in machine learning these days that no one can say they are from a different field, as they owe their maturity (to some extent) to this community. As it is clear, it is really difficult to claim if these parts of this collection are really different, however, the grouping has been taken place for the sake of cleanness and familiarity of the titles.
